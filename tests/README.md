## Writing Tests

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from config import Config

def test_config_defaults():
    """Test default configuration values"""
    config = Config()
    assert config.FIELD_SIZE == 100
    assert config.DEVICE == 'cpu'

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    """Create Flask app for testing"""
    from app import app
    app.config['TESTING'] = True
    return app

def test_health_endpoint(app):
    """Test health check endpoint"""
    with app.test_client() as client:
        response = client.get('/health')
        assert response.status_code == 200
```
