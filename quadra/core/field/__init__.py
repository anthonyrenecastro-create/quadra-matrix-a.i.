"""
Field Dynamics Module - Substrate-Level Physics

🌊 POETIC:
The foundation upon which all emerges—ten cosmic fields in resonant harmony,
creating the substrate for consciousness through sacred geometry and adaptive
self-regulation.

⚙️ MECHANICAL:
Implements field-theoretic foundations for CognitionSim:
- Interplayed Field Theory (IFT) ten-field substrate
- 12-fold angular symmetry via resonant tensors
- Atlantean control: adaptive thresholds and leak rates
- Hybrid IFT-neural integration
